## Project Overview

### 1. This is a multi-module AI system designed to assist pharmacy operations and decision-making. It combines:
- AI-based medical consultation & triage
- Sales forecasting using Prophet
- OCR-powered barcode & price extraction
- Drug suggestion from symptoms
- Inventory checkout/invoice system
- NLP-based review analytics
- Machine learning-based loan/churn predictions
### 2. Run from:
- `main_cli_app.py` for interactive CLI
- `main_api_app.py` for RESTful API

## Enhancements in CLI & AP
### CLI Mode (``main_cli_app.py``)
- Select options 1–10 from a simple numbered interface
- Inputs handled via keyboard
- Forecast saved as CSV

### API Mode (``main_api_app.py``)
- Exposes ``/predict_churn``, ``/diagnose``, ``/chat``, ``/forecast``, etc.
- Accepts JSON payloads
- Can be plugged into a frontend later (e.g., React/Flutter)
--- 
## Future Work
- Add user authentication layer
- Add database backend (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Real-time camera price scanner
- Host web UI (Streamlit or Flask Web)
- Add automated tests (PyTest)
